# Artificial Intelligence (CS7IS2) Project 2019-2020

### Developed by
* Utkarsh Bhardwaj
* Taranvir Singh 
* Akshay Mathur
* Nikhil Girraj Khandelwal

## Dataset - We used the dataset used in the article ["How to Generate Music using a LSTM Neural Network in Keras"](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-generate-music-using-a-lstm-neural-network-in-keras-68786834d4c5)

## Algorithms Used - 
1. LSTM 
2. Bi-directional LSTM
3. GRU
4. GAN (we took up an additional model after an extension to the original deadline)

> The code for this was developed on Google Colab Worksheets. This helped immensely in sharing the latest code and availability of hardware capabilities like GPU and TPU.
